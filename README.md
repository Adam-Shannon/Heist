# Readme

Heist is a programming language for Bigraphs implented in a interpreter in ```Heist/bin``` with dependent backend library ```Heist/lib``` which implements the languages backend evaulation constructs independently. Also provided in ```Heist/test/lib``` is a second miniature library with simple functionality allowing users to unit test their own code written in Heist, sample programs written in Heist (```Heist/test/Heat```) and equivalent *BigraphER* representations (```Heist/test/BigrapherTemplates```) are provided including **JSON** implementations of all the necessary Bigraphs and reaction rules in (```Heist/test/Bigrapherfiles```).

## Additional Information
This project was originally created as an undergraduate dissertation available here at [Bigraph Strategies](https://github.com/Adam-Shannon/Heist/blob/662ff51d14146e9678c0ef3719092a5cff59ea77/BigraphStrategies.pdf) which contains significant work on a theoretical description of the language using small step operational semantics along with design ideation and justifying use cases, the dissertation may also serve as a good starting point for those interested in the theory of Bigraphs but could become out of date as Heist evolves and is kept within this repo mostly for archival context.

For any questions about Heist feel free to contact adam.shannon02@gmail.com , I am currently not working full time on Bigraphs/Heist but intend to maintain the language in my spare time with occasional additions on request.

## Build instructions

##### Fundamental setup
Beginning from the Heist directory it is recommoned that a new opam switch is created to prevent package version conflicts, the switch can have any desired name for example *my_switch*.

```
$ opam switch create my_switch  ocaml.4.13.1
$ opam switch my_switch
```

Next the dune build system should be installed in the switch to enable automated gathering of other dependencies.

```
$ opam install dune
```

##### External dependencies - BigraphER

dependencies *BigrapheER* and the associated *Bigraph* librabry cannot be installed directly using dune or Opam and must be acquired from [uofg-bigraph-tools](https://bitbucket.org/uog-bigraph/bigraph-tools/src/yojson/). 

After cloning the yojson branch of the Bigraph tools repository outside of the Heist directory dune is used to build and install the bigraph-tools packages.

```
$ dune build --profile=release
$ dune install --profile=release
```
 - Note this external dependecy may require other packages which aren't automatically installed by it's build system including ```menhir```,```progress```,```dune-configurator``` and ```ppx_deriving_yojson``` which will raise errors if missing, these can be installed independently with ``` opam install ``` if necessary. 

To verify installation ``` opam list ``` can be used to check whether the correct packages have been installed and should look like:

##### building Heist from source

finally returning to the Heist directory any remaining dependencies can be installed using the .opam file generated by dune.

```
$ opam install . --deps-only --with-test --with-doc
```

Finally, dune can be used to build the Heist interpreter.

```
$ dune build
```

Once the build has been successfull the ```heist.exe``` interpreter should exist within the Heist directory and developer documentation can be accessed using ```open _build/default/_doc/_html/index.html```

### Requirements

* Ocaml : >=  4.13.1
* dune : >= 3.13.0
* Packages:  
  * automatically installable : listed in `Heist.opam`
  * manual instalation : [bigraph](https://bitbucket.org/uog-bigraph/bigraph-tools/src/yojson/)
* Tested on Ubuntu and WSL2

### Test steps

##### Automated unit testing 

Two suites of unit tests can be run to ensure Heist is working correctly which should all pass and can be triggered using:

```
$ dune runtest --force
```

##### Manual program execution 

Heist comes provided with a number of sample programs to demonstrate how typical programs written in the language should look. One of these programs stored in "testrun.heat" can be evaluated using the interpreter as follows:

```
 $ ./heist.exe test/Heat/testrun.heat test/Bigraphfiles/comms.json
```

* Note the *heist.exe* interpreter is by default created in the ```Heist``` directory so any filepaths when working with examples should be relative to ```Heist``` unless the executable has been moved
